## Project Overview
**Journi** is a tourism trip planning platform developed using Next.js, Supabase, K-Means, and Simulated Annealing algorithms, aimed at providing personalized itineraries for tourists. The platform centralizes trip planning processes and allows for real-time collaboration among users. It offers both pre-trip and on-trip planning phases, enabling users to define trip details, manage destinations, and optimize routes. Additionally, it facilitates collaboration with travel partners and allows budget tracking during trips.

## Features

### User Management
- **User Profiles**: Create and manage user profiles with options to log in, update profiles, and manage account settings.
  
### Trip Planning
- **Trip Details**: Define trip dates, travel preferences, and search for destinations.
- **Itinerary Creation**: Create custom itineraries with optimized routes using K-Means and Simulated Annealing algorithms.
  
### POI (Points of Interest) Management
- **POI Discovery**: Search, discover, and add Points of Interest (POIs) to itineraries.
- **POI Management**: Easily manage and customize POIs within an itinerary.

### Collaboration Features
- **Invite Travel Companions**: Share trip itineraries with travel companions and invite them to collaborate.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Plan trips collaboratively with features such as polls, broadcasts, and shared itineraries.
- **Broadcast Messages**: Send broadcasts to notify trip participants of important updates in real-time.
  
### Budget Tracking
- **Set a Budget**: Define a travel budget for the trip.
- **Monitor Expenses**: Track and manage expenses throughout the trip.
